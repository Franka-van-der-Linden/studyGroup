# A practical guide on how to spread the good parole!
When you organise a Study Group event, it is very important to properly advertise it.

## Advertise through emails  
Secretaries from SILS and IBED can be reached through two mailing adresses:
- SILS secretaries (Laura & Aly): sils-secr-science@uva.nl
- IBED secretaries: Secr.IBED.WTCW-science@uva.nl

Here is an example email that you can send to both secretary offices:

Dear Study Groupers,
Tomorrow Tuesday, we have a session on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This tool brings out patterns in your (big) data and can be used to visualize and explore data.     
In this hand on tutorial PCA will be explained in simple terms. Further it will be shown how to do a PCA and how to visualize the results in R.  
After this one-hour session you should be able to do a PCA on your own data. If you bring your data (not too big, please) we could even try to do some work within this hour.    
Please bring a laptop if you can although you can also participate without one.  
Type of session:  
- 20min introduction by Huub Hoefsloet (Assistant-Professor, Biosystems & Data Analysis
- 40min hands-on workshop on a dataset + "Bring Your Own Data" session.  
Level: beginner & advanced users  
Where: Science Park 904, room A1.14  
When: tomorrow Tuesday from 16.00 to 17.00    
Lesson is available here. Please make sure you have R version 3.5 or higher if you wish to complete the hands-on part.  
Regards,  
Marc, on behalf of the Study Group board

## Advertise through the Slack workspace
A Slack workspace (__scienceparkstudygroup.slack.com__) was created to help general communication within the local study group community.  
If you are not a member of the Science Park Study Group Slack workshape, use this [link](https://scienceparkstudygroup.slack.com/join/signup "Join the Slack workspace").  
Once you are in Slack, you can post an event in the #general channel. Simply type `/events create` in the #general channel. 

## Advertise through posters
Simple posters hanged in the corridors, at the coffee corners, etc. to announce the event are always efficient! You can find an example of a previously made poster [here](../blob/master/posters/2018/2018-oct-dec-events.pdf).

## Make sure the Google Calendar is updated
You can sign in and then add your event in the Google Calendar. It will automatically sent a notification in the Slack #general channel.
To connect to the calendar, use the following credentials:  
login: amsterdamscienceparkstudygroup@gmail.com    
pwd: studygroup

## Advertise through people: people bring people!
What works best is perhaps to tell the people around you that a specific event is happening! You can explain what it's about and why people should come.
