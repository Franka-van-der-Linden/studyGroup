    "We can tell that Circos saved the plot in two formats (svg and png) in the directory from which we run this notebook (./). It is better to save the output somewhere else, namely in the output directory we created. We can specify the desired output location and name of the file on the commandline with `-outputdir /path/to/your/output/directory` and `-outputfile yourimage.png`, but we can also specify this in the configfile, which I prefer, because then we have a log of which settings lead to which output.  \n",
