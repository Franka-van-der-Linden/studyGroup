# Visualizing genome comparisons with Circos
 [Circos](http://circos.ca/) is program that allows you to visualize data in ciruclar format. This format is explicitly convenient to show links between two or more sets of ordered data. It is originally designed for genomics, but it can definetely be used for other types of data as well. Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-rTAr3pj5g) (52 mins.), where the designer of Circos explains the importance of good data visualization, shows examples of how figures can be made more clear and explains how we best abide to the limits on what a human can process visually.     
    
A one-hour demo showing how to use the program to plot results from comparative genomics. In this example, we ask the questions whether histone modifications are conserved over longer evolutionary time. We will compare the genomes of two fungi (_Fusarium oxysporum_ and _Fusarium graminearum_) and two histone modifications (dimethylation of the second lysine and trimethylation of the 27th lysine of histone 3). The figure generated in this demo will very likely end up in a paper that the instructor is currently working on.  
  
In this demo, we will go step-by-step through the entire process: downloading genomes and ChIP-seq data from public repositories, aligning the genomes, aligning ChIP-seq reads, plot homologous regions in the two genomes and ChIP-seq read densities. Because this is a lot to do in one hour, it will probably be a demo only, without hands-on experience. However, the notebook that describes every step I take will be published online, which allows you to try this by yourself. If you run into any problems, just send me an e-mail and drop by on a Study Group hacky hour. I'd like to end with a short discussion on data visualization.   

At the end of this lesson you will:  
- have an idea of how to approach a comparitive genomics project 
- how to explore your results using circular visualization.
- (hopefully) be inspired to use circular visualizations to clarify your data.
