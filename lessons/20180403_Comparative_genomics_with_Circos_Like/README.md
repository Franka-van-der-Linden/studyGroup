# Visualizing genome comparisons with Circos
 [Circos](http://circos.ca/) is program that allows you to visualize data in circular format. This format is explicitly convenient to show links between two or more sets of ordered data. It is originally designed for genomics, but it can definetely be used for other types of data as well. Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-rTAr3pj5g) (52 mins.), where the designer of Circos explains the importance of good data visualization, shows examples of how figures can be made more clear and explains how we best abide to the limits on what a human can process visually.    
    
This will be a one-hour demo showing how to use the program to plot results from comparative genomics. We will use Python scripts to generate the input files for Circos.
  
In this demo, we will go step-by-step through the entire process: downloading genomes from public repositories, aligning the genomes, and plotting homologous regions in the two genomes. It is designed to be an interactive demo, which means that there won't be time for hands on exercises, but I will ask you to think along in writing code and -importantly- in developing our idea on what we want to visualize and then how we will do this. 

The notebook that describes every step I take will be published online, which will allow you to try this by yourself. If you run into any problems, just send me an e-mail and drop by on a Study Group hacky hour. I'd like to end with a short discussion on data visualization.   

At the end of this demo you will:  
- have an idea of how to approach a comparitive genomics project 
- how to explore your results using circular visualization.
- (hopefully) be inspired to use circular visualizations to clarify your data.
