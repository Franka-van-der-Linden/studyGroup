## Marc Galland
Marc exposed a proposal coined "the SILS & IBED Data Clinic" to improve data analysis and management at both institutes. It is meant to become a place to get support in various data analysis themes (bioinformatics, statistics) but also to develop practical solutions (pipelines, online applications).
