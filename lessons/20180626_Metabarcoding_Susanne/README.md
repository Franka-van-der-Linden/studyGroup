# Introduction


# Lesson objectives
At the end of this lesson, you will:
- Be able to understand the major steps of a 16S/18S rRNA metabarcoding analysis
- Have undertaken one to several steps of the workflow (see below)
- Have identified potential pitfalls in these steps.

# Steps
**Step 1**: Quality filter raw reads (example workflow for workshop)  
**Step 2**: Dereplicate your dataset  
**Step 3**: Make a sequence variant table
**Step 4**: Identify chimeras and remove chimeric sequences 
**Step 5**: Assign taxonomy to your sequences based on a reference database  
**Step 6**: Visualize and analyze microbial community composition
