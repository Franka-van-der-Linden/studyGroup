 - **Authors**: Like Fokkens (Postdoctorate fellow, SILS) & Marc Galland (Data Science/Manager Facilitator, SILS)
 - **Research topic**: Research Data Management
 - **Language**: None (Web browser)
 - **Level**: for beginners
 - **Lesson topic**: submitting your data and metadata to public repositories

## Learning objectives
After this lesson, you will:
- know the public repositories for genomic and metabolic datasets
- get an idea of what they expect in terms of data and metadata for submission
- understand the benefits of publishing datasets into public repositories

## Description
In this workshop we'll show some example of how metadata is used to retrieve relevant studies from online resources and we'll show some examples of metadata we've provided with studies we've submitted.


## The MetaboLights repository
From the [MetaboLights website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/):
> MetaboLights is a database for Metabolomics experiments and derived information. The database is cross-species, cross-technique and covers metabolite structures and their reference spectra as well as their biological roles, locations and concentrations, and experimental data from metabolic experiments.
MetaboLights is the recommended Metabolomics repository for a number of leading journals.

### Why would I use it?
- To store your own metabolomic research in a safe and reliable way.
- To get an accession number for your metabolomic study that you can cite in your publication (it is asked by reviewers).
- To be able to store the experimental _metadata_ along with the _raw data_.
- It is hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute so it is a safe and reliable way to preserve and access your research.
- To collaborate with other research groups in an open but protected manner (authentification).

### What can I do with MetaboLights?
- Find metabolites and related metablomics studies by searching a wide range of associated metadata.
- Filter your search results on species, techniques and metabolites.
- Submit public or private studies.
- Receive a stable and unique accession number that can be used as a publication reference.
- Share private studies with collaborators/peer reviewers.
- Download public metabolomics studies for futher analysis.
- Retrieve molecular information from ChEBI or other linked compound databases.

### How to retrieve a dataset?
For instance, let's say your favorite organism is tomato :tomato: and you particularly like to work with a :de: research group headed by Alain Tissier. Just guessing!     
1. Go to the [MetaboLights website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/).
2. Under Study, click on "Browse" <img src='../../img/metabolights-browse.png' align="right" height="80" /></a>.
3. Filter for _study_ and _mass spectrometry_ in the __Type__ box.
4. Filter for _mass spectrometry_ in the __Technology__ box.
5. Type "Solanum lycopersicum" in the __Organism__ tool.
6. Finally, select "leaf" in the __Organism part__.

All submitted data is encoded in the standardised and open ISA-Tab format.

### Submitting a dataset
What is this ISA-Tab format?
