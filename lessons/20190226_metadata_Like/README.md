 - **Author**: Like Fokkens (Postdoctorate) & Marc Galland (Data Science/Manager Facilitator, UvA-SILS)
 - **Research topic**: Research Data Management
 - **Language**: None (Web browser)
 - **Level**: for beginners
 - **Lesson topic**: submitting your data and metadata to public repositories

## Learning objectives
After this lesson, you will:
- know the public repositories for genomic and metabolic datasets
- get an idea of what they expect in terms of data and metadata for submission
- understand the benefits of publishing datasets into public repositories

## Description
In this workshop we'll show some example of how metadata is used to retrieve relevant studies from online resources and we'll show some examples of metadata we've provided with studies we've submitted.


## Submitting to MetaboLights
From the website:
> MetaboLights is a database for Metabolomics experiments and derived information. The database is cross-species, cross-technique and covers metabolite structures and their reference spectra as well as their biological roles, locations and concentrations, and experimental data from metabolic experiments.
MetaboLights is the recommended Metabolomics repository for a number of leading journals.
