# Spatial data visualisation

In this lesson, we will show how to visualise spatial datasets using Python. This can be important for visualizing field data in an easy way using python as a GIS.

# Lesson objectives
After this lesson, you will:
- Be able to visualise vector and raster dataset along with google map
- Understand projections, and basic basemap package functionalities

# Setup

We are using binder environment for carrying out the lesson, no installation is required. Click on the link below.

## Datasets used
- [california cities](https://github.com/awantik/data-science/blob/master/data/california_cities.csv)  
- netcdf file 

# Vocabulary
- Remote sensing: different measurements (points, images) made from a distance.
- GIS: Geographic 

# Suggested tools

- [RasterFrames](http://rasterframes.io/): RasterFrames™ brings the power of Spark DataFrames to geospatial raster data, empowered by the map algebra and tile layer operations of GeoTrellis. 
- [Kepler](https://uber.github.io/kepler.gl/#/): kepler.gl is a data-agnostic, high-performance web-based application for visual exploration of large-scale geolocation data sets. Built on top of deck.gl, kepler.gl can render millions of points representing thousands of trips and perform spatial aggregations on the fly.
- [Folium](http://folium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) : interactive mapping using python environment using Leaflet. 
- [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/): Open Source Geographical System: can display different layers on a map.

# Suggested open city data sources
- [Paris Data](https://opendata.paris.fr/page/home/)
- [New York City Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)
