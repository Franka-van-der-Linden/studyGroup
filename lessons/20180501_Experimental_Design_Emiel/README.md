# Experimental Design

A joke to start this lesson:
> One statistician and a biologist are condemned to death.  
> The judge grants them with a last favor: "What would you like ?" ask the judge to the statistican.  
> The statistican says: "I would like to teach a big conference on statistics to the world"  
> The judge asks the biologist: "what would you like?"  
> The biologist: "I would like to be executed first!"

**Experimental design is a way to carefully plan experiments in advance so that your results are both objective and valid**.  
Ideally, your experimental design should:
- Describe how participants are allocated to experimental groups. A common method is completely randomized design, where participants       are assigned to groups at random. A second method is randomized block design, where participants are divided into homogeneous blocks (for example, age groups) before being randomly assigned to groups.
- Minimize or eliminate confounding variables, which can offer alternative explanations for the experimental results.
- Allow you to make inferences about the relationship between independent variables and dependent variables.
- Reduce variability, to make it easier for you to find differences in treatment outcomes.

Design of experiments involves:
- The systematic collection of dat
- A focus on the design itself, rather than the results
- Planning changes to independent (input) variables and the effect on dependent variables or response variables
- Ensuring results are valid, easily interpreted, and definitive.

The most important principles1 are:
- **Randomization**: the assignment of study components by a completely random method, like simple random sampling. Randomization eliminates bias from the results
- **Replication**: the experiment must be replicable by other researchers. This is usually achieved with the use of statistics like the standard error of the sample mean or confidence intervals.
- **Blocking**: controlling sources of variation in the experimental results.
