# Experimental Design

A joke to start this lesson:
> One statistician and a biologist are condemned to death.  
> The judge grants them with a last favor: "What would you like ?" ask the judge to the statistican.  
> The statistican says: "I would like to teach a big conference on statistics to the world"  
> The judge asks the biologist: "what would you like?"  
> The biologist: "I would like to be executed first!"
