# A story of ducks

This is a story of little ducks fed by a researcher. He wants to know whether a food supplement can actually speed-up the growth rate of these little ducks.

# Setup
**Research question: Is my food supplement stimulating the growth of duckings?**

Material: 60 ducklings born on the same day.

What is wrong with this first set-up?

What is still wrong with this set-up?

# Final experimental 
One additional piece of information. Enclosure A is actually colder than enclosure B.   
Temperature here is a confounding factor: something that might trouble your conclusions.

To solve this, one might want to *block* to control for the unwanted fluctuating temperatures.
