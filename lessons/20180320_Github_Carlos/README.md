# Setup

## Github account
If you don't have an account on [Github](https://github.com/), please make one before the lesson. Other than that, there is no setup required. 

## Softwares used
- __Github:__ [Github](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
- __Jekyll:__ Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.https://jekyllrb.com/
