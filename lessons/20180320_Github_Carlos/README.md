# Create your own personal website with Git/Github
A one-hour practical where we are going to create a personal website for academics powered by Github. 

## Lesson objectives
At the end of this lesson:
- You will dispose of a personal website online where you can add your CV, talks, presentations, etc.
- You will discover the Github system (no command line involved) to perform file version control. 

### Time and Place
- Where: room B0.203, Science Park 904  
- When:  Tuesday, March 20th, 2018 at 17:00 PM

### Authors
- Carlos Martinez (Software Engineer & Software Carpentry Instructor, eScience Center)
- Mateusz Kuzak (Community Manager, Dutch Techcenter for Life Sciences)
- Marc Galland (Postdoctoral researcher, Plant Physiology@SILS)

### Level
Absolute beginners and begginers.  

# Setup

## Github account
If you don't have an account on [Github](https://github.com/), please make one before the lesson. Other than that, there is no setup required. 

## Softwares used
- __Github:__ [Github](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
- __Jekyll:__ Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.https://jekyllrb.com/
