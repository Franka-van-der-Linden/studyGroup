# Exchange your laboratory notebooks
 - **Authors**: Franka van der Linden (PhD, SILS) & Marc Galland (Data Science/Manager Facilitator, SILS)
 - **Research topic**: Research Data Management
 - **Language**: None (Web browser)
 - **Level**: for beginners
 - **Lesson topic**: organising your lab book and data in an understandable way

## Learning objectives
After this lesson, you will:
- know what your collegues think if your experimental documentation and have input to improve
- be inspired by different approaches to store your data in a retrievable way

## Description
In this workshop we will direct you to think critically about the way you store your data, both online and offline (laboratory notebook).    
1. Documenting a process: the Lego case.  
2. In the first part we will open our labbooks to collegues to see if the way we document our experiments is understandable to others. 
3. In the second part we will go into storing your data on the computer. We will open a discussion on different ways to do so, after showing you some examples of ourselves and colleagues.

## Lego building (10 min) - Marc
We'll start with some lego activity to see how easy (or not) it is to document a simple process. This will help to start the discussion!

## exchange labbooks (15 min) - Franka
Some explanation and tips:
- Critically look: is all data and metadata available to reproduce the experiment? 
- Do I understand references to methods?

## Different ways to organise your project & data, examples from colleagues (15 min) - Franka

## Brainstorming session (15 min) - Everybody
- Did these first activities triggered new questions?
- How can we improve experimental descriptions ?

## Systems for data documentation (5 min) - Marc
- Simple data documentation: Zenodo upload.
- 4TU guidelines: https://researchdata.4tu.nl/en/publishing-research/uploading-data/
