## Learning objectives
After this lesson, you will:
- know what is the tidy format and the logic behind it.
- be able to convert a "messy" data format into a "tidy" format using the `tidyr` package.


## Lesson outline
1. Loading the `tidyverse` library and downloading the dataset  
2. Get a first peek into the dataset: `head`, `glimpse`, `View`
3. Why is this format not handy to answer data questions?
4. Identify experimental factors from measured values: defining the key-value pairs of the `gather` function. `?gather` 
5. 


## Setup 
### R and RStudio
You should have R and RStudio installed on your machine.   
Get R here: https://lib.ugent.be/CRAN/  
Get RStudio here: https://www.rstudio.com/  

### Dataset
The dataset is visible on the Github lesson repository. No need to download it, we'll download it together.

## Prerequisites
You should know how to start RStudio and have an understanding of the different panels of RStudio that's all.  
This lesson is for beginners as we will perform the commands together.
