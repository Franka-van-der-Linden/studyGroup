# Machine Learning applications in Biology

# Lesson outline

## Lesson objectives
At the end of this lesson:
- You will know more about Machine Learning: what it is and how it can be applied to your research.
- You will learn about a particular type of Machine Learning method called Random Forest. 
- You will be able to run a Jupyter Notebook to execute the popular Machine Learning [scikit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)

## Time and Place
- Where: room B0.203, Science Park 904  
- When:  Tuesday, March 20th, 2018 at 17:00 PM

## Authors
- Zsofia Koma (PhD student, UvA-IBED)
- Stefania Astrologo (PhD student, UvA-SILS)
- Marc Galland (Postdoctoral researcher, UvA-SILS)

## Level
Begginers and advanced beginners.  

## Setup

There is no setup required as the Jupyter notebook will run online in the cloud. 

## Tools used
- Python, a modern and popular programming language. 
- mybinder: a tool to run Jupyter notebooks in the cloud online. You don't need to install anything.
