Leading and making a one-hour lesson is maybe the most immediate way to contribute. You can either 
1. Create a new lesson repository inside the [lessons](lessons/) repositories. Name it with the date of the lesson, the subject and the person leading it. For instance `20190102_Shiny_demo_Joachim`
2. Create a `README.md` file into that new repository. This file should contain:
  - the author(s) of the lesson
  - the topic of the lesson
  - the entrance level for that lesson i.e. "beginner", "false beginner" or "advanced" for instance. 
  - the prerequisites for that lesson.
3.

We use the [Markdown formatting language](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to format the `README.md` file for every lesson.
