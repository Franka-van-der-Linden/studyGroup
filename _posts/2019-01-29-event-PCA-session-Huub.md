title: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - Huub Hoefsloot & Marc Galland
text:  Principal Component Analysis is a tool to bring out patterns in your (big) data. It can be used to visualize and explore data. In this hand on tutorial PCA will be explained in simple terms. Further it will be shown how to do a PCA and how to visualize the results in R. After this one-hour session you should be able to do a PCA on your own data. If you bring your data (not too big, please) we could even try to do some work within this hour.
