title: Exploratory data analysis with R by Joeri and Marc
text: This lesson will help you to process and explore the flights dataset. This example dataset is already in the tidy format (one measurement per line). We will explore a few useful functions to get basic statistics on the dataset and make exploratory plots. These are the first steps in the Research Data Life Cycle (see the scheme below).
